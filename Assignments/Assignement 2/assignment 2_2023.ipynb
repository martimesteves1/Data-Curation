This is to be expected since the more cases there are, the more the disease spreads, and therefore more vulnerable segments of the population are infected and consequently die. Also, a high number of cases means that local health care systems are overworked and preventive public health measures are less effective.\n","\n","The correlation between confirmed cases and the incident rate is positive but still relatively weak, which is surprising since the incident rate is calculated by dividing the number of confirmed cases by the population size. In principle, the more cases there are, the higher the incident rate should be, and counties with high populations should have more difficulty controlling outbreaks, since the flow of people is a lot higher within counties than across the country or between countries. However, since incident rate only takes into account population size and not population density, the weak correlation is plausible.\n","\n","The correlation between the number of deaths and the case fatality ratio is also positive but very low, which is counter-intuitive, since more deaths should increase the fatality of a disease. However, because the fatality ratio is calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the number of confirmed cases, and because the confirmed cases and deaths increase at similar rates, the ratio is not very sensitive to changes in the number of deaths. So the very weak correlation makes sense.\n","\n","The final noteworthy correlation is between the incident rate and the case fatality ratio, which is a weakly moderate correlation. This is also a counter-intuitive result, since the higher the incident rate, the more cases per population we have, and therefore the bigger the spread of the disease, particularly to the vulnerable segments of the population, causing a higher death rate. But this is not necessarily the case, since theoretically, having a low incident rate means that only a small subset of the population would be infected, and by consequence, the death rate could range from very low to very high, depending on whether the vulnerable segments were infected. So, if the spread is random, we would expect a weak correlation.\n","There are also a number of additional factors that would contribute to a negative relationship. The main one is the fact that high incident rates happen in places with high population density that have more healthcare resources to tackle the disease and therefore would have a lower death rate. Public policy for pandemic response was also not uniform across the US. The response to the pandemic was much more effective in US blue states, where there are typically more urban and densely packed areas and therefore higher incident rates, than in red states, which are typically more rural and less densely populated. The blue/red divide comes to mind particularly in regard to the support for vaccination campaigns, which were much more effective in blue states than in red states.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3YFIAsCl0ezb"},"source":["## Question 10 (5 points)\n","\n","Find the number of miscalculated samples when the ```Case_Fatality_Ratio```(%) is not equal to 100 * Deaths number divided by Confirmed number.
